This dataset, provided by David Vivancos, is composed of records of 2 seconds of EEG signals using several non-medical grade headsets. During the experiment, the subject was presented digits (0 - 9) on a computer, and tried to focus on the digit for about two seconds. The goal is classifying EEG signals into 10 categories, each of which represent a number between 0 and 9 which is obseverd by the subject.
