# Extracting-Image-from-EEG-signals
## Abstract
Consider that we were able to read the human mind, vision, and hearing, and transfer them into a machine. Without any shadow of doubt, this tempting idea can pave the way for quite a few advancements in the technology. Take, for instance; we were able to use human sight in a machine. By doing so, we could use human vision potentials in many machine vision applications. <br />
In general, the goal of this project is reconstructing an image, seen by a human, from the EEG signals which are captured when the very human was looking at the image. In particular, I am using MindBigData IMAGENET of the Brain dataset, in which a specific subject looks at pictures, which are randomly selected from ILSVRC2013 dataset, and electroencephalogram signals are recorded from five different brain locations.
## Mind big data
[http://www.mindbigdata.com/] <br />

This dataset, provided by David Vivancos, is composed of records of 2 seconds of EEG signals using several non-medical grade headsets. During the experiment, the subject was presented digits (0 - 9) on a computer, and tried to focus on the digit for about two seconds. The goal is classifying EEG signals into 10 categories, each of which represent a number between 0 and 9 which is obseverd by the subject.
